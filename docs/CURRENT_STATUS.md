# Project Status: Netopo - Network Configuration Impact Analysis Platform

## Current Status
*   **Project Name**: Netopo - Network Configuration Impact Analysis Platform.
*   **Current Phase**: Phase 6 - Dynamic YANG-based Dependency Discovery (Completed). [PROGRESS.md]
*   **Overall Progress**: 98% (Phase 1-5 Complete + Dynamic Architecture Enhancement). [PROGRESS.md]
*   **MVP Achievement**: Universal Configuration Impact Analysis CLI Tool with Dynamic YANG Discovery - DELIVERED. [PROGRESS.md]
*   **Core Capabilities**: Dynamic Schema-Driven Dependencies, Generic OpenConfig Approach, Universal Diff Engine, Professional CLI, Multi-Vendor Support, Neo4j Integration. [PROGRESS.md]

## Last Done
*   **Phase 6: Dynamic YANG-based Dependency Discovery (COMPLETE)**:
    *   Replaced hardcoded dependency analysis with dynamic YANG schema introspection. [PROGRESS.md, SESSION.md]
    *   Implemented `DynamicDependencyAnalyzer` for schema traversal and `leafref` discovery. [SESSION.md]
    *   `ConfigDiffEngine` now uses dynamic discovery, removing protocol-specific logic. [SESSION.md]
*   **Universal Diff Engine Architecture (COMPLETE)**:
    *   Implemented a generic `UniversalDiffEngine` for recursive comparison. [PROGRESS.md, SESSION.md]
    *   Introduced `config/path_mappings.json` for vendor-specific path translation. [SESSION.md]
    *   Ensures accurate before/after value display (`- current_value` / `+ proposed_value`). [SESSION.md]
*   **Phase 5: Universal Configuration Impact Analysis System (COMPLETE)**:
    *   Enhanced `ConfigDiffEngine` with cascade impact analysis. [PROGRESS.md, SESSION.md]
    *   Implemented 2-hop graph traversal for direct and cascade dependencies. [SESSION.md]
    *   Improved CLI display with quantified metrics and dependency icons. [SESSION.md]

## Remaining
*   **Immediate Debugging**: [PROGRESS.md]
    *   Investigate why CLI command is not returning proper diff or dependencies.
    *   Resolve missing `ietf-yang-types` dependencies for full schema loading.
    *   Ensure ACL application and other relationships are properly ingested into the graph database.
    *   Validate dynamic analyzer schema traversal and reference discovery.
*   **Phase 3: API & User Interface**: [PROGRESS.md, PROJECT.md]
    *   Develop FastAPI backend (REST API, WebSockets, Auth).
    *   Develop React frontend (React Flow for visualization, config submission, "blast radius" visualization).
*   **Phase 4: Operational Readiness**: [PROGRESS.md, PROJECT.md]
    *   Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, code quality tools).
    *   Implement integration testing framework.
*   **Documentation & Future Roadmap**: [PROGRESS.md, PROJECT.md]
    *   API documentation, graph schema documentation.
    *   Define future enhancements (extended vendor support, advanced analytics, enterprise integration).
