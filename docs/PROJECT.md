1. Executive Summary & Strategic Overview
The primary goal is to build a Network Configuration Impact Analysis Platform that leverages modern, model-driven data to de-risk network changes. The platform will serve as a comprehensive, enterprise-grade tool for analyzing device configurations that are provided in a structured, YANG-modeled format.

Core Architectural Principles:
Modular Monolith: The application will be a single, deployable unit but internally structured with modular, pluggable loaders for each vendor/OS combination.
Structured File Ingestion: The application will ingest configuration data from a directory of structured data files (e.g., hostname.json, hostname.xml).
Graph Database as Source of Truth (SoT): A Neo4j graph database will serve as the definitive, versioned SoT for all network topology, configuration, and dependency data.
Hybrid YANG Model Strategy: The application will be designed to consume and merge data from both vendor-neutral OpenConfig models and vendor-native YANG models to create a complete and accurate representation of the network state.
Phase 1: Foundation & Core Data Engine
Goal: Establish a robust pipeline for ingesting, validating, and merging structured, YANG-modeled configuration data from local files.

Task 1.1: Project Setup & Environment
1.1.1: Initialize Python Project: Set up a Python (>3.11) project with a virtual environment and a comprehensive directory structure:

1.1.2: Install Core Dependencies:
Validation & XML Parsing: yangson, xmltodict.
Graph Database: neo4j.
API Framework: fastapi, uvicorn.
CLI Framework: click.
1.1.3: LLM Assistant Prompt:
"Generate a pyproject.toml file for a Python 3.11 project with the following dependencies: yangson, xmltodict, neo4j, fastapi, uvicorn, click, and pytest for development."

Task 1.2: Data & Model Curation
1.2.1: Gather Network Data: Populate ./data/ with a representative dataset for 12+ devices. The dataset should cover a wide range of protocols and services, with configurations provided in both JSON and XML formats to test the full data pipeline. The target OS list must include:
Cisco IOS-XE (RESTCONF - JSON)
Cisco NX-OS (RESTCONF - JSON)
Cisco IOS-XR (NETCONF/RESTCONF - JSON/XML)
Arista EOS (RESTCONF - JSON)
Juniper Junos (NETCONF - XML)
An inventory file (./inventory/inventory.csv) mapping hostnames to vendor and OS.
L2 neighbor information files (./topology/) containing CDP and LLDP adjacency data.
1.2.2: Curate YANG Models: Download and organize relevant OpenConfig and vendor-native YANG models for all targeted operating systems into the ./models/yang/ directory. These are needed for the validation step.
Task 1.3: Data Loading and Validation
1.3.1: Implement File Ingestion Logic: Create a module to scan the ./data/configs/ directory, read each file, and use the inventory to select the correct vendor-specific data loader plugin.
1.3.2: Develop First Loader Plugin (e.g., for a Junos device):
Step 1: Load and Normalize Structured Data: Read the input file. If it is a .json file, load it directly into a Python dictionary. If it is an .xml file, use the xmltodict library to parse it into a Python dictionary, ensuring a uniform data structure for the next step.
Step 2: Build the "Composite Model": If vendor-native data is provided separately, implement logic to merge the vendor-native dictionary into the base OpenConfig dictionary. This creates a single, unified JSON object.
Step 3: Validate Output: Use the yangson library to validate the final JSON object against the corresponding YANG schemas. This is a mandatory step to ensure data integrity before it is passed to the rest of the application.
1.3.3: LLM Assistant Prompt:
"Write a Python function that takes an XML string as input and uses the xmltodict library to convert it into a Python dictionary. Then, using the yangson library, write a second function that takes this dictionary and validates it against a pre-loaded openconfig-interfaces YANG model."

Task 1.4: Testing & Validation
1.4.1: Create Unit Tests: For each loader plugin, write unit tests that feed it sample JSON/XML files and assert that the data is loaded, converted, and merged correctly.
1.4.2: Build a Test Fixture Library: Create a comprehensive set of test cases, each consisting of an input data file and the expected, validated JSON output.
Phase 2: Graph Database & Command-Line Interface (CLI)
Goal: Persist the structured data in a versioned graph database and build a functional CLI for impact analysis, delivering early value to the team.

Task 2.1: Neo4j Setup & Data Modeling
2.1.1: Deploy Neo4j Instance: Set up a local Neo4j Community Edition instance using Docker.
2.1.2: Design Temporal Graph Schema: Design the graph model using a tool like Arrows.app.
Nodes: :Device, :Interface, :VLAN, :ACL, :RouteMap, :IPNetwork.
Relationships: :HAS_INTERFACE, :MEMBER_OF_VLAN, :APPLIED_ACL, :CONNECTED_TO.
Versioning: Implement a temporal pattern with immutable identity nodes and versioned state nodes linked by :HAS_STATE and :LATEST relationships.
Task 2.2: Graph Ingestion Pipeline
2.2.1: Develop the "Graph Modeler" Module: This module will consume the validated JSON from Phase 1.
2.2.2: Write Idempotent Cypher Queries: Use parameterized MERGE statements to create or update nodes and relationships without creating duplicates.
2.2.3: Ingest L2 Topology Data: Create a separate ingestion function to read the L2 neighbor files (from Task 1.2.1) and create :CONNECTED_TO relationships between :Device nodes. This builds the physical network map.
Task 2.3: Dependency Analysis Engine & CLI
2.3.1: Develop Core Analysis Logic:
Create a function to load a proposed config file into an in-memory "Composite Model" object.
Implement logic to "diff" this in-memory object against the current state in the graph to identify changes.
Write parameterized Cypher queries that traverse the graph from the changed nodes to find all dependencies.
2.3.2: Build the Analysis CLI:
Use the Click library to create a command: impact-analysis --device <hostname> --file <path/to/proposed-config.json>.
This command will trigger the analysis engine and print a human-readable impact report to the console.
2.3.3: LLM Assistant Prompt:
"Write a Cypher query that starts at a given :Interface node, finds the :ACL node applied to it via an :APPLIED_ACL relationship, and then returns all other :Interface nodes that also have the same ACL applied."

Phase 3: API & User Interface
Goal: Create an intuitive web-based interface for users to submit proposed changes and visualize the "blast radius" of the impact.

Task 3.1: API Development
3.1.1: Set Up FastAPI Application: Initialize a FastAPI project to serve as the backend.
3.1.2: Define API Endpoints:
POST /analyze: Accepts proposed configuration data (as JSON) and a target device.
GET /topology: Returns a simplified list of devices and connections.
GET /dependencies/{node_type}/{node_id}: Retrieves detailed dependencies for a specific node.
Task 3.2: React UI Development
3.2.1: Set Up React Project and choose a visualization library with strong out-of-the-box functionality like React Flow or Cytoscape.js.
3.2.2: Build Submission UI: Create a UI with a text editor for pasting proposed configuration data.
3.2.3: Implement "Blast Radius" Visualization: When the analysis is complete, the UI should visually highlight the changed node and all affected downstream nodes, along with a summary panel.
Phase 4: Operational Readiness & Future Vision
Goal: Ensure the application is robust, well-documented, and has a clear path for future enhancements.

Task 4.1: CI/CD Pipeline for Application Quality
4.1.1: Set Up CI Pipeline (GitHub Actions or GitLab CI): On every commit, automatically run code linting, unit tests, and YANG model validation (pyang --lint --strict).
4.1.2: Implement Integration Tests: On every merge, run end-to-end tests that ingest a full library of test data files and validate the final graph state and API responses.
Task 4.2: Documentation & Future Roadmap
4.2.1: Create Documentation: Document the graph schema, loader logic, and API endpoints.
4.2.2: Define Future Vision (Post-MVP):
Vendor Expansion: Develop additional loader plugins for other key vendors and operating systems.
Enterprise Integration: Integrate with ITSM systems like ServiceNow.
Intent-Based Analysis: Enhance the engine to support "what-if" scenario modeling.
Enterprise Readiness: Implement a robust security framework, including Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
